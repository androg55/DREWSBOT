"""
The pinylib rtc implementation of the new tinychat WebRTC beta version.

I have tried to use as many methods/function names from the old RTMP version as possible. Although some 
methods/functions have been renamed, it should be familiar if you should have used pinylib before.

I have put in as many comments, as i could with the understanding of the protocol i have so far.
